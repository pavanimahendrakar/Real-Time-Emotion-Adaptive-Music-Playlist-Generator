# Real-Time-Emotion-Adaptive-Music-Playlist-Generator
Build a system that listens to a userâ€™s voice (or facial expressions via webcam) in real-time, detects the current emotion (happy / sad / calm / excited, etc.), and then selects or generates a music playlist that adapts to their emotional state. Over time, personalize the recommendations based on user feedback (likes/dislikes) and context etc.
